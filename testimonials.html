                <span class="dblqt">&#8220;</span>Diz is the ultimate teacher showing an enormous depth of understanding
                of all aspects of yoga. She has the wonderful capacity to quietly and consistently teach in a way that
                honours tradition and keeps it real as part of our  lives. She's willing to work with anybody at their
                own level, and is always tuned in to student needs.<span class="dblqt">&#8221;</span><br/>

                <span class="dblqt">&#8220;</span>My Hatha Yoga fix with Diz is the highlight of my working week.
                For more than 10years, Diz has been maintaining us with a high level of gentle attention that leaves us
                feeling as though she is speaking directly to each of us. Working in the health service field, we are
                all aware of the benefits of unwinding, stretching and strengthening &mdash; during the working day we
                need assistance to straighten out of our desk chair posture. Diz's experience provides us with the
                support and range of options to modify our movements to enable us to engage with maximum benefit. I've
                become a yoga convert with Diz's skillful teaching.<span class="dblqt">&#8221;</span><br/>

                I have practiced yoga for over a decade with Diz Randall. During these years I have witnessed her
                exceptional capacity as a yoga teacher. Whilst she has excellent skills in demonstrating asanas, her
                quintessential gift is her ability to cater for individual needs. So whether you are a beginner or an
                experienced yogi you will always benefit from her classes. Diz is a woman of integrity and it has been
                my blessing to share her intuitive approach to yoga.

                I love Diz's style of yoga. She imparts great knowledge and respect for all aspects of yoga and conducts
                a class that is inclusive of all levels of ability. I always feel relaxed by the end of a session which
                is good therapy.

                The sacred space Diz creates each week is such a blessing and a gift for me on a deeply personal and
                spiritual level. Her teaching and guidance has lead me and carried me through some very tough times. I
                am deeply and profoundly grateful.

                Practicing yoga with Diz is a holistic experience. I began practicing yoga with Diz when I was 14, and
                over the past six years the physical practices have increased my strength and awareness of my body. Yet
                I notice countless other benefits from yoga every day. I have developed a strong sense of respect for
                not just myself and others, but also life and everything it entails. Diz's passion as a teacher of yoga
                in its various forms has been central in helping me to identify and cultivate this awareness and
                respect.

                One of the best things I have ever done for myself was join Diz's yoga classes on Wednesday nights. It
                has been a life-changing experience in many ways. I get incredible teachings and support from one of the
                best yoga instructors around. If you have the chance to do yoga with Diz, you will be amazed &ndash;
                she is the best.
