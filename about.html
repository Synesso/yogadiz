            <p>
                My interest in yoga probably began watching the exotic Swami Saraswati on TV in the late 1960s. Then as a
                college student I came across &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, the inspired and incredible life story
                of Yogananda, the yogi who helped to introduce yoga to the west.
            </p>
            <p>
                After college I travelled through Asia, spending 6 months in India. It was very intoxicating and definitely
                gave me a different perspective on life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back home I found myself spending a long weekend at Satyananda Ashram in northern NSW. A friend had taken
                me there. It fascinated me and motivated me to come home and find a teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                I attended classes with several Satyananda teachers and loved them. But the teachers moved on leaving me
                still looking for that teacher to commit to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually found Glenda Gooding in 1988 and began an earnest and passionate journey as one of her many
                dedicated students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glenda ran the Sherbrooke Centre in Belgrave Heights in the Dandenong Ranges. I made the trip up and down
                those hills from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glenda encouraged me to do my teacher training and I completed her very satisfying and life-changing course
                in 1993.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know now that finding the right teacher was pivotal in my journey of becoming a teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                With qualifications in hand the practical process of becoming a good teacher begins. Finding students and
                consolidating what you have learnt and bringing it into the classroom is a slow, evolving process.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked from my home, in local leisure centres and community houses, health centres, schools and businesses.
                I accepted all opportunities that came my way. I continued as I do today to attend classes, workshops and
                retreats and remain interested in ongoing learning. I have a continuous appetite for reading as much yoga
                literature that I can find.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a teacher of many years I feel I am now able to teach from my own truth and experience and feel my
                teaching has become more intuitive and inspired. I have maintained my &quot;tapas&quot;, deep passion
                towards teaching and practice and have remained continuously curious and enthusiastic.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this I would like to thank all the many and varied teachers who have inspired me on this ongoing journey.
            </p>
            <h4>Style</h4>
            <p>
                A hatha yoga approach which uses mindful movement and posture, breath awareness, relaxation, meditation
                and yoga philosophy to help guide students into a deeper understanding of self.
            </p>
            <p>
                These classes pay homage to the traditional model of yoga.
            </p>
            <p>
                Classes are considerate and sensitive to the individual needs of the students. Classes allow time for
                people to connect and reflect.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intention is to help students bring the wisdom of yoga into their practice and their daily lives.
